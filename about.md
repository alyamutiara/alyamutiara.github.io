ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! I'm [Your Name], a computational science graduate from Institut Teknologi Bandung with a bachelor's degree in physics. With over 3 years of hands-on experience as a cloud system engineer in the digital company, I've honed my skills in crafting scalable solutions on cloud platforms and navigating the intricacies of cloud infrastructure.

Currently on a mission to merge my passion for data with my technical expertise, I've embarked on a transformative journey. I left my role as a cloud system engineer to dive deep into the world of data analytics, driven by the excitement of working with vast datasets, creating insightful visualizations, and uncovering meaningful relationships within the numbers.

As I pursue my master's degree, I'm actively engaged in self-taught learning, participating in courses and certifications that sharpen my skills for the role of a data analyst. My GitHub repositories showcase my evolving proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. From hands-on projects to insightful explorations, each repository reflects my commitment to mastering the art of data storytelling.

Let's connect and collaborate on this data-driven journey! Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or someone with insights to share, your input is invaluable. Feel free to explore my projects, offer feedback, or connect with me on alyamf [at] gmail [dot] com as I build my path towards becoming a data analyst.

Happy coding and data exploration! ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š
